# Wepin iOS SDK PIN Pad Library v1

Wepin Pin Pad library for iOS. This package is exclusively available for use in iOS environments.

## ‚è© Get App ID and Key
After signing up for [Wepin Workspace](https://workspace.wepin.io/), go to the development tools menu and enter the information for each app platform to receive your App ID and App Key.

## ‚è© Requirements
- iOS 13+
- Swift 5.x

## ‚è© Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice for v1.0.0 Update
>
> üö® Breaking Changes & Migration Guide üö®
>
> This update includes major changes that may impact your app. Please read the following carefully before updating.
>
> üîÑ Storage Migration
> ‚Ä¢    In rare cases, stored data may become inaccessible due to key changes.
> ‚Ä¢    Starting from v1.0.0, if the key is invalid, stored data will be cleared, and a new key will be generated automatically.
> ‚Ä¢    Existing data will remain accessible unless a key issue is detected, in which case a reset will occur.
> ‚Ä¢    ‚ö†Ô∏è Downgrading to an older version after updating to v1.0.0 may prevent access to previously stored data.
> ‚Ä¢    Recommended: Backup your data before updating to avoid any potential issues.
>
> üì¶ Compatibility with WepinLogin
> ‚Ä¢    If you are using this module alongside WepinLogin, please ensure that you are also using `WepinLogin` v1.0.0 or higher.
> ‚Ä¢    Mixing different major versions of Wepin modules may result in compatibility issues, unexpected errors, or inconsistent behavior.
> ‚Ä¢    For a stable integration, always use v1.0.0+ across all Wepin modules together.

>üÜï What's New in v1.1.0
> ‚úÖ WepinPin now includes WepinLogin by default. ‚Ä¢ Starting from v1.1.0, the WepinLogin module is bundled within WepinPin.
> ‚Ä¢ You no longer need to install or manage WepinLogin separately when using WepinPin.
> ‚Ä¢ This simplifies integration and reduces dependency management for login-related features. ‚Ä¢ For consistent behavior, please ensure all Wepin modules used are updated to v1.1.0 or higher.


WepinPin is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'WepinPin'
```

## ‚è© Getting Started
### Import WepinPin into your project.
```swift
import WepinPin
```

## ‚è© Initialize
Before using the created instance, initialize it using the App ID and App Key.

  ```swift
let appKey: String = "Wepin-App-Key"
let appId: String = "Wepin-App-ID"
var wepinPin: WepinPin? = nil
let initParam = WepinPinParams(appId: appId, appKey: appKey)
wepinPin = WepinPin(initParam)

  ```

### init

```swift
await wepinPin?.initialize(attributes: attributes)
```

#### Parameters
- `attributes` \<WepinPinAttributes> 
  - `defaultLanguage` \<String> - The language to be displayed on the widget (default: 'en'). Currently, only 'ko', 'en', and 'ja' are supported.

#### Returns
- \<Bool>
  -  Returns `true` if success

#### Example
```swift
let attributes = WepinPinAttributes(language: "en")
if let res = try await wepinPin?.initialize(attributes: attributes) {
    print("Successed: \(res)")
} else {
    print("Failed")
}
```

### isInitialized

```swift
wepinPin!.isInitialized()
```

The `isInitialized()` method checks if the Wepin PinPad Libarary is initialized.

#### Returns

- \<Bool> - Returns `true` if  Wepin PinPad Libarary is already initialized, otherwise false.


### changeLanguage

```swift
wepinPin!.changeLanguage(language: "ko")
```

The `changeLanguage()` method changes the language of the widget.

#### Parameters
- `language` \<String> - The language to be displayed on the widget. Currently, only 'ko', 'en', and 'ja' are supported.

#### Returns
- \<Void>

#### Example

```swift
wepinPin!.changeLanguage(language: "ko")
```

## ‚è© Method & Variable

Methods and Variables can be used after initialization of Wepin PIN Pad Library.

### generateRegistrationPINBlock
```swift
await wepinPin!.generateRegistrationPINBlock()
```
Generates a pin block for registration. 
This method should only be used when the loginStatus is pinRequired.

#### Parameters
 - `viewController` \<UIViewController> __optional__ - The view controller from which the login widget (WebView) will be presented modally. It provides the display context to ensure the widget appears on the correct screen.

> [!NOTE]
> You may optionally provide a UIViewController as a parameter.
> If provided, the WebView will be presented using the given controller.
> If omitted, the SDK will automatically attempt to find the top-most UIViewController on the main thread.
> 
> In some cases (e.g., during modal presentation or custom containers), automatic detection of the top view controller may fail. It is recommended to explicitly pass a UIViewController when possible.
   
#### Returns
 - \<RegistrationPinBlock>
   - uvd: \<EncUVD> - Encrypted PIN
     - b64Data \<String> - Data encrypted with the original key in b64SKey
